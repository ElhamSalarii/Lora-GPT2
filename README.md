# LoRA-QA Fine-tuning (GPT-2)

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Provide a concise, end-to-end workflow for fine-tuning GPT-2 with LoRA on the SQuAD dataset to enable accurate question answering.

- **Why LoRA?** Reduces trainable parameters while preserving performance.
- **Dataset:** SQuAD (question-answering format).
- **Output:** Trained model checkpoints, evaluation metrics, and example prompts.

## Key Features
- Lightweight fine-tuning with LoRA
- Prompt-based data processing for SQuAD
- Dynamic boxing and masking via a data collator
- Reproducible experiments with clear checkpoints and results

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch compatible with your CUDA version (if using GPU)

## Configuration and Reproducibility

- **Configuration:** Provide a minimal, readable config (e.g., `config.yaml` or `.json`) that includes:
  - Model name and size (GPT-2 base/large)
  - LoRA rank and alpha
  - Dataset paths and preprocessing options
  - Training hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- **Seed:** Set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
- **Logging:** Log training progress, validation metrics, and system info (CUDA version, PyTorch version).

## Directory Structure (high-level)

- `lora_qa_finetuning.py` – main training entry point
- `evaluate.py` – evaluation scripts and metrics
- `docs/` – optional documentation
- `model_checkpoints/` – saved model checkpoints
- `results/` – evaluation results, logs
- `plots/` – graphs and visualizations
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies

## Evaluation Metrics

- **SQuAD metrics:** Exact Match (EM), F1
- Other metrics as applicable (perplexity, etc.)
- Provide sample evaluation outputs in `results/` for quick reference

## Examples and Demos

- Include a minimal example prompt format and expected QA output.
- Show how to run a quick sanity check with a small subset of data.

Example prompt snippet:
- Input: “Who wrote the book '1984'?”
- Context: paraphrased passage from SQuAD context
- Output: “George Orwell”

## Testing

- How to run unit/integration tests (if applicable)
- Commands to verify data processing, model loading, and a small inference run
